# Sequence Generator

A simple Python program that creates arithmetic and geometric sequences.

## What it does

- **Arithmetic Sequences**: Adds the same number each time (like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14)
- **Geometric Sequences**: Multiplies by the same number each time (like 2, 6, 18, 54)
- Calculates sums and products of sequences

## Files

- `sequence_generator.py` - Main program (run this one)
- `test_sequences.py` - Tests to make sure everything works

## How to run

```bash
python3 sequence_generator.py
```

## How to test

```bash
python3 test_sequences.py
```

## Example

**Arithmetic Sequence:**
- First term: 3
- Add: 4 each time
- Length: 5 terms
- Result: [3, 7, 11, 15, 19]
- Sum: 55

**Geometric Sequence:**
- First term: 2  
- Multiply by: 3 each time
- Length: 4 terms
- Result: [2, 6, 18, 54]
- Sum: 80

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- No extra packages needed
